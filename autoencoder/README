# Autoencoder

Learns a mapping from a higher dimensional binary representation to a lower dimensional binary representation.
Usage:

python dA.py [train-file] [num-epochs] [batch-size] [output-prefix]

train-file:
Should be a comma-separated file, with samples in rows and features in columns. The loss function is designed considering the features to be binary. 

Final error:
5 dimensions, 20 batch size - 150.889 cost
2 dimensions, 20 batch size - 158.878 cost
1 dimensions, 20 batch size - 200.614 cost
